# IsoArchEAA
Data for EAA presentation Aug 2022

This project is to explore the data available in the IsoArcH database that's related to the Ancient Near East. 
Much of the findings are presented at the EAAs in Budapest in September 2022. 

You'll need R for this code. I've already downloaded the data available in IsoArcH on 13 Aug 2022, but if you want to see the most up to date database, check out IsoArcH.
