Okay, let's try to figure this whole clean data shit out. 

First, our base file is C:\Users\chris\Documents\GitHub\IsoArcHEAA\isoarch_2022-08-09_16_48_25.csv

If we put it into OpenRefine, we get 13350 records. 
Errors include: 
* refSampleIsoarch 15080 (two rows) where "Young child c. 2" should be the agePubliClassName but is divided into two. 
* refSampleIsoarch 15082 (two rows) where "Young child c. 1-3" should be agePubliClassName
* refSampleIsoarch 15095
and more

Facet "sampleType" to see several mistakes

If we try to read the .csv through R...umm okay actually it works. Are you fucking kidding me.
